# PKR-HOI: Priori Knowledge Reasoning for Human-Object Interaction Detection
![arc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23740707/141664966-a7457456-0422-4c57-b21f-539c886dc172.png width="200")
PKR-HOI is a priori knowledge based framework that models scene context, human and object features, action recognition, and interaction relationship in a unified way for accurate HOI prediction. PKR-HOI aggregates the different-level features and attention mechanism in the transformer, and as a result, achieves high HOI detection performance with HOI decoder.
