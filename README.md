# PKR-HOI: Priori Knowledge Reasoning for Human-Object Interaction Detection
wulinmenghuantejing/PKR-HOI
PKR-HOI is a priori knowledge based framework that models scene context, human and object features, action recognition, and interaction relationship in a unified way for accurate HOI prediction. PKR-HOI aggregates the different-level features and attention mechanism in the transformer, and as a result, achieves high HOI detection performance with HOI decoder.
